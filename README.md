# Request-Management-Sysytem-for-educational-institutes
Simple web application for handling student requests in educational institutes


This is our group project, “software tool to handle student request”, for the module Engineering Skill Development in semister 2 at UoM. In this course, we are required to design and develop a software tool to handle student request in a scenario where students send requests to academic staff on matters such as late add/drop requests, extend assignment submission deadlines, repeat exams as first attempt with the next batch etc. This project gives an understanding towards how to implement a software tool for specific requirements.
